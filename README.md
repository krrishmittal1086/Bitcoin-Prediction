# CRYPTOVIS: Bitcoin Price Prediction Project  

Welcome to **CRYPTOVIS**, a machine learning and deep learning project focused on predicting Bitcoin's closing price using historical data. This project explores patterns in key financial indicators and develops reliable forecasting models to assist in market trend analysis and investment strategies.  

## 📖 Project Overview  
The objective of this project is to analyze five years of historical Bitcoin data (2017-2022) and predict closing prices. Using features like Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume, we implement models to generate accurate predictions for cryptocurrency market trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and many more
- **Models:**  
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
  - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  
  - Random Forest Regressor  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes the following attributes:  
- **Date**  
- **Open**  
- **High**  
- **Low**  
- **Close**  
- **Adj Close**  
- **Volume**  

## 🚀 Key Features  
1. Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to identify patterns.  
2. Time-series predictions using LSTM and RNN for sequential data handling.  
3. Random Forest Regressor for feature-based predictions.  
4. Visualization of model performance and prediction trends.
5. Interactive Power BI Dashboard is developed to analyze model performance and compare metrics such as prediction accuracy, error rates, and trends for LSTM, RNN, and Random Forest Regressor models, providing insightful visualizations for better understanding.
